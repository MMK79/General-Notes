Success in life will be determined by:
1. ability to speak 
2. ability to write
3. quality of ideas 
$$Quality = f(\large K, P, t)$$
How much Knowledge you have, How much your Practice with that Knowledge, and your inherent talent (t is small but it is matter)
* With right amount of knowledge you will be better than the people that only have the talent
Ideas and technics that will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by people
Rule of Engage: No laptop, No cellphone $\rightarrow$ humans only have one language processor, if you engaged with laptop/cellphone it will effect on the peoples around you (funny part is that you can actually see this in the subway, when you standing next to someone that has a cellphone and reading his massages you have the urge to take a look at what he/she is reading)

## How to start Presentation?
some people think right thing to do is to start a talk with a joke (Not recommended, why? cause in the beginning of a talk people are still putting their things away to focus on you, they're becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters, to your vocal parameters, so they are not ready for a joke)
**Start with Empowerment promise** $\rightarrow$ what will they know after listening to you after the talk - reason their being here $\rightarrow$ (what I think is good base on this for educational propose) is to give a overview of the lesson of that session before starting it $\rightarrow$ in my mind Abu-Yaser Mostafa doing this great in his Machine Learning Course
### Heuristic Samples
* Cycle on the Subject: go around it, go around it again, go around it again --> tell them what you want to tell them, then tell them again, and then tell him a third time (as if people weren't intelligent) $\rightarrow$ at any given moment about 20% of you will be fogged out no matter what the lecture is
* Build a Fence around the idea: so it can be distinguished from other people ideas
* Verbal Punctuation: because people will occasionally fog out and need to get back on the bus, you need to provide some landmark/places where you announcing that it's good time to get back on $\rightarrow$ provide outline
* Ask a Question: How long should you pause for the answer? standard time, 7 seconds + question need to be carefully chosen $\rightarrow$ can't be too obvious cause then people embarrassed to say it, can't be too hard cause nobody can say anything

* watch the speaker that you admire and ask yourself how they do it, then you can build up your personal repertoire and develop your personal style

* Time: 11 am, most people are awaken by then, and hardly anyone has gone back to sleep
* Place: room must be well lit, if the room is dimly lighted it signals that we should go to sleep + Cased, you as a speaker need to go there before giving speech you need to go to the place to get a good understanding of environment + reasonably populated, more than half full

## Boards, Props, Slides
* **Write on Board** when you talk is good for when you are **Informing** $\rightarrow$ Graphic Quality, Speed Property (speed that you write on the board is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas), Target (people novice at speaking find themselves suddenly aware of their hands, and want to hide it so you will see them that they will put it in the pocket which is rude and insulting in some cultures, it feels like that you are concealing a weapon, with board you can simply point at stuff with your hand)
* **Props** will help you to think about the problem in the right way
* **Slides** good for when you **Exposing**
	* Read your transparencies:
		people in your audience know how to read and reading will just annoy them. Also, you should be sure that you only have a few words on each transparency and that the words are easy to read
	* Stand far way form the projected transparency
		People in the audience will have to divide their attention and end up looking at your presentation as if it were a tennis match, with their heads swinging as the ball flies back and forth
	* Use goofy clip art
		try to have a picture or icon on each slide, but not goofy clip art. Use simple, easy to comprehend images that will serve as handles for your ideas.
	* Incorporate background patterns
		They are distracting and make the text hard to read
in a Simple way:
* Do not read (you don't need to have the title on each slide, you can say the title, don't need logos on every slide, keep it simple, less word, less material in the slide, more attention on you)
* Be in the Image
* Keep images simple
* Eliminate clutter

* Problem with pointers and laser pointers is that you showing your back of your head to the students and this cause you to lose contact with audience, instead use arrows in power point
* don't have a too heavy power point (full of world no image and etc.)
* you can only have one and only one hard slide per presentation what we call hapax legomenon
* In survey Student want more Props more chalk and less slides, props + board $\rightarrow$ empathetic mirroring (it gives you a feeling that you doing it yourself) 

## Informing Presentation
* Promise: you need to give a promise what will they get from being here instead of other places
* Inspiration: People inspire by someone exhibited passion about why they were doing
* How to Think: we are storytelling animals, provide them with story that they need to know, question that they need to ask about that story, mechanisms for analyzing those stories, ways of putting stories together, ways of evaluating how reliable a story is

## Persuading
### Oral Exams(Thesis Session...)
the most usual reason for people failing oral exam is failure to situate(it is important to talk about your research in context, now everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things such situating and time and place and feel) and a failure to practice.
* showing slides to other people in the office that you work with is not a practice, why? if people know what you are doing they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there, so go to the friends that don't know what you are doing and present for them and you can say this to them "if you can't make me cry, I won't valued you as a friend" (you want them to wreck you :D)
* The amount of Flak you get is proportional to age, what does it mean? The more old someone is the more understand what is their place in the world,. but the young people are trying to show to the old people how smart they are, so best practice is presenting to old committee 
### Job Talks
* Vision: problems that you care about, something new in your approach
* Done Something: By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to that problem 
tell both these in 5 minutes
* Contribution
### Getting Famous
* Why should you care about getting famous? you will get used to be famous, but you never get used to be ignored
* How do you get to remembered? 
	* Symbol, associated to your work
	* Slogan, a kind of phrase that provides a handle on the work
	* Surprise
	* Salient Idea, not Important necessarily but idea that sticks out
	* Storytelling

## How to Stop
What is the Final Slide?
* put your collaborator on the first slide, not the last slide
* No Question in the last slide
* No The End! in the last slide
* No Thank You! in the last slide
* Contributions most be the your last slide
What is the Final Words?
* You can tell a Joke
* Not Thank you, it is weak move, when you say it, it feels like that everybody stayed that long out of politeness and they had profound desire to be somewhere else.
* Salute Audience
