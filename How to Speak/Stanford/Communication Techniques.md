Spontaneous Speaking: When you are in a situation that you are asked to speak off the cuff and in the moment.
Responding to Cold Calls $\rightarrow$ Introduction, Feedback, Toasts ,Q&A
## Anxiety Management
* Anxiety Actually helping us, it gives us energy, gives us focus, tells us what we're doing is important, but we need to manage it.
* As a communicator you need your audience feel comfortable so they will be ready to hear your massage.
* 85% people getting nervous when they are speaking in public
### Techniques to handle Anxiety
1. Greet your anxiety: when you start to feel anxious just simply accept it, and say yes I am feeling nervous and this is pretty normal and natural, till will help your anxiety to not overflow you and you get a grip on it. (it not necessarily stop it, but it stop it go get higher)
2. Reframe how you see the speak situation: when you present there is no right way, understand that presenting/speaking is not a performance (so everything have a right line, with right tone, in a right time, at the right place, you made a mistake) it simply is **Conversation**.
	1. Start with Questions: Question by their very nature are dialogic, they're two way, it get the audience involve and help the presenter to get the sense of conversation
	2. Conversational language
3. Be present oriented: simply don't think about the consequences and the future. to reach this state, you can be physically active (do push ups, slowly walk) or listen to music, or even counting backward, you can even use tongue twisters(cause if you don't be in the moment you will say them wrong + it will warm up your voice (I slit a sheet, A sheet I slit, And on that slitted sheet I sit))
## How to feel Comfortable when you Speaking Spontaneously
1. Get out of your own way: when we talk spontaneously we want to be perfect, we want to always give the right answer. don't plan and work to get it right(when you plan something you will get it right or wrong, so simply don't plan so the result of what you do won't get the sense of right or wrong), just do it. 
	* Game to train your brain to get out of its own way(no stockpile, no pattern): simple game that can help you understand this, point at things and shout their name by the wrong word, for the first time you will find that your brain will give you pattern instead of words, do this exercise again, and this time if you see that your words have pattern just disregard the words and go on
		* you can play this everywhere, anytime
		* it work against a muscle memory that you've developed over the course of your life
		* In essence we are reacting (you thought and now acting on it, to long and too thoughtful) instead of responding(genuine and authentic)
		* Dare to be Dull
2. See the speaking as an opportunity, not as a challenge or a threat 
	* Game: exchange imaginary gift with your partner, your partner will open up the gift and tell you what you gave them, once you open the box say the thing that comes to your mind at that moment not the thing that you thought of, then answer to what they say the reason that they gifted you, the person who received the gift will say what he sees, and the person who presented the gift will say why he bought you that gift)
	* instead of using "No, but" use "Yes, and" it open up so tremendous amount of opportunities. this doesn't mean you need to always answer to question yes, no this is more like an approach, if someone ask you question be like yes and I will follow through instead of No and I will be defensive about it
3. Slow Down and listen: You need to understand the demands of the requirement you find yourself in, to answer appropriately. we listen just enough to think we got it and we answer. as a communicator your job is to be in service of your audience. and if you can't what your audience is asking or need, you can't fulfill that obligation.
	* Game: talk about something fun that you plan to do for today, but instead of speak normally spell it (it helps with focus and listening and you can't be thinking ahead
	* Don't just do something; Stand there
4. Tell a Story: Structure
	* Why speak with structure? increases processing fluency/information by 40%
	*   Structure 1: Problem/Opportunity $\rightarrow$ Solution $\rightarrow$ Benefits
	* Structure 2: What? $\rightarrow$ So What? $\rightarrow$ Now What?
	* Game: Sell something to your partner, with one of these 2 solutions
* When you in spontaneously speaking situation, you do two things simultaneously, What to say? How to say it?

* Hostile situation: first it should not surprise you, before speaking you should think what is the environment going to be like? Acknowledge the emotion but don't name them cause then you gonna fight for what mental state their in, reframe the question in a way that is more comfortable for you and then answer.
* Co-located audience: be mindful of it, try to include engagement techniques where the audience actually has to do something(imagination, pool feature, monitor their behavior)
* think about most common things that will happen and be ready for them, and provide some evidence to support them, don't memorize script, but remember ideas and themes and then put them together
* Paraphrase allows you the opportunity to reframe it, think about answer, to pause and make sure you got it right
* Humor: is it funny? (How do I know, ask other people) What happens if it doesn't work?(Have a backup plan) if you can't answer these 2 question don't use humor, it is very risky, if it doesn't work, it will put you further from your audience
* ask people to give advice + why
