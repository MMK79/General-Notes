1. Basics
* Discrete Mathematics with Application - Susanna S. EPP: Basic Mathematic Logic without any knowledge in Algebra - Better than next one
* Discrete Mathematical Structures - Kolman, Busby, Ross: Logic, set, Proofs
* Mathematical Proofs A transition to advanced Mathematics - Gary Chartrand, Albert D. Polimeni, Ping Zhang: Advance - read what you can, understand what you can, move to the next book, teach you how to write proof - Math Major - Better than next one 
* An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics - Robert J. Bon, William J. Keane: learn how to write Proof - Math Major 
2. Algebra
* Pre-Algebra - AGS: have solution, Basic
* Pre-Algebra - Fearon's: no solution - Better than the previous one
* College Algebra - Jerome E. Kaufmann: If you don't need the pre-algebra; more beginner friendly than the next one
* Intermediate Algebra: You can skip this part, most of the book are mostly contain problem not much concept
* College Algebra - Blitzer
* A Graphical Approach to Algebra & Trigonometry - Hornsby, Lial, Rockswold: Pre-Calculus, You can start here, if you have knowledge of the previous books
3. Calculus
* Calculus - James Stewart: Basic Calculus, Problems + Explanations, use for calculus 1, 2, 3
	* Calculus - Larsen
* Calculus - Michael Spivak: less material, more advance, Need Proof Writing skill to understand
4. Differential Equations:
* A first course in Differential Equations with modeling applications - Dennis G. Zill
* Ordinary Differential Equations with application - Larry C. Andrews: Easier, good for beginner 
5. Linear Algebra
* Elementary Linear Algebra - Howard Anton: Beginner friendly, college level course, problem similar to exams
* Linear Algebra - Stephen H. Friedberg, Arnold J. Insel, Lawrence E. Spence: Proof Base
	* After this point you can learn most of the undergraduate math
6. Probability & Statistics:
* Mathematical Statistics with applications - Dennis D. Wackerly, William Mendenhall III, Richard L. Scheaffer: Need more calculus than the next book
* A First Course in Probability - Sheldon Ross: need calculus for some portion
6. Complex Numbers:
	* You can jump here after calculus and skip the differential equations
* Fundamental of complex Analysis with application to Engineering and Science - E. B. Saff - A. D. Snider: Beginner Friendly
* Complex Variables and Application - James Ward Brown, Ruel V. Churchill: Beginner Friendly
7. Analysis:
* Analysis I, II - Terence Tao: reading friendly, good example than other books
* Advanced Calculus - Patrick M. Fitzpatrick: Beginner Friendly
* Principles of Mathematical analysis - Rotten
* Elementary Analysis: The Theory of calculus - Kenneth A. Ross: Proof Base
8. Abstract Algebra: groups, ring, fields, proof base, need linear algebra
* Abstract Algebra A First Course - Dan Saracino: Beginner Friendly
* Contemporary Abstract Algebra - Joseph A. Gallian: Beginner Friendly
9. Topology
* Introduction to Topology - Theodore W. Gamelin, Robert Everist Greene: have solution
10. Combinatorics
* Applied Combinatorics - Alan Tucker
11. Set Theory: you can learn this with linear algebra
* Naive Set Theory - Paul R. Halmos
Randoms:
* Introductory Functional Analysis with applications - Kreyszig: need advance calculus, how to write proof, easy
* Graph Theory - Ronal Gould
* Real Analysis - H. L. Royden: measure theory - graduate level mathematics, hard
* Real and Complex Analysis - Rudin
* Linear Algebra - Serge Lang
* Linear Algebra - Kenneth Hoffman, Ray Kunze: used in MIT, proof base
* Algebra - Michael Artin: Abstract Algebra with emphasis on Linear Algebra
* Calculus Made Easy - Silvanus P. Thompson: more intuition
* Geometry - Jurgensen Brown King: Basic Geometry
* Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces - Paul R. Halmos: Linear Algebra
* Linear Algebra: Seymour Lipschutz, Marc Lipson
* Linear Algebra and Applications - Gilbert Strang: MIT lecture
