## My suggestion
* Learning how to type fast is necessary in the age of technology:
	* Your keyboard is your pen now, so learning how to use your pen is essential
	*  It will help you to have so much better time when you using your computer
	* It will save so much time for you, and you will be less scared to make mistake in your search process
* It is a time consuming process but doing it 15 minutes everyday will help you so much
* Most Important thing in the process of learning how to type is, "do not look at your keyboard" so I suggest to enable the keyboard visibility in monkey type and try to find the place of a key by just looking from the visual keyboard
* I suggest typing quotes cause they are so much similar to what you will type in reality but in the start of journey, typing words will be so much better
* your first goal in typing is so simple, you want to achieve 60 word per minute, this will be enough for most of the things that you want to do in real life and will help you to save time and energy
* after learning how to type, you will find it very addictive and you will enjoy it so much so don't be scare in start of your journey and keep it going and you will see very good results in such a small amount of time
* if you want to type a long word/word, the first step is to break it down in parts that you can type without stopping in between
* Key to typing fast is simple you need to read ahead of your typing, what I mean is if you have "Hello world" what you want is to type "Hello" and in the process of typing "Hello" reading the next word "world", when you want to type faster and faster you need to optimize this process for longer, what I mean is that instead of just reading 1 word ahead you need to be like 4 word ahead, but believe me you will not need this for achieving 60 WPM
* most important thing is that your rest position in typing
* you have uphill on F and J this will help you to find your rest position fast
* accuracy is so much important than speed when you are learning how to type so don't try to type fast in sacrifice of your accuracy
* You can enable an option in monkey type that will avoid you to press wrong shift in keyboard (for keys that you type with right hand, you will use the left shift, and for the keys that you type with left hand, you will use the right shift)
* in the process of learning how to type you will most likely don't use number keys, so after you learned how to type letters, it will be good to check how to write numbers too, and it will be so much faster and easier to learn this part
* it is different for most people but little finger most of the time will be a problem
* "Ctrl + Backspace" is so underrated, it will clear the whole word, and when you learn to type fast, it will be so much better most of the time to delete the whole word and type it again, than just deciding how many "Backspace" that you need to press to achieve the point that you want
* you will use your right hand little finger a lot --> for "Backspace" + "Enter" so train it hard
