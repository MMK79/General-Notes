## My suggestions:
In Option>Files and links
* Change default location for new attachment to "In subfolder under current folder"
* Change default location for new notes to "same folder as current file" 
* There is a Git plugin that will automate the Pushing process of your vault, but doing the push process by your own is so much better cause you don't want to always push every single little change, and you can manage your vault better
* You can download Markdown version of internet pages with Google chrome plugin and use them in your Note/Vault https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi
